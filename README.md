Marshmallow Schematics
======================


Inspired by [Schematics](https://github.com/schematics/schematics).

Whereas Marshmallow is an excellent serialization/deserialization
and validation library, it wasn't intended to be a class or type
definition library, which Schematics was.

This library provides a Schematics-like Model but
using Marshmallow's Fields and validation.
